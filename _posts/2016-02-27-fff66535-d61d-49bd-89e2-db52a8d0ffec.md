What an odd start to 2016

It was strange from its earliest moments this year - Nicole and Alex for New Year's Eve and a wonderful meal, one misplaced comment and a car ride later yelling and running barefoot and drama.  

I am trying to navigate the next moment of our relationship.  I have been looking deeply at how to reclaim responsibility for my happiness.  For some reason, gradually, parts of me have been blaming you for my unhappiness.  Not that I am sad all of the time or anything, generally life is good and it is working.  Benjamin is a wonderful addition to our family and strengthens a bond between us.

I mean that I have been reflecting on where I thought I would be in my life and who I would be with; versus where I am; and the distance between them.  There is a gulf, a disappointment with some feeling of success and what is here.  I am not just disappointed that you are not my fantasy man but I am having trouble finding respect for you within.  I am painfully surprised to discover that I don't respect you.

"What does that mean??" I ask myself.  "Does it mean that he is not worthy of your respect which connotes a distaste for who the person is?"  No, I does not mean that to me because when I have my responsible lens back in place, I see it differently.  I engage a little curiosity and I ask myself to notice when I next feel that distasteful feeling.

It happened last night when you shared your work situation and what you planned to do about it.  As we prepared dinner, I listened to you talk about building a wall between work and home.  I observed myself judging rather than listening to you.  By the end of the meal I realized that my biggest problem with your response was that you weren't doing what I would do.  What \*I\* would do?  This wasn't about me, it was about you and I was the one who was not respecting you in the moment.  That made me stop dead in my tracks.  From the outside, here we were eating eggs on toast or yoghurt and honey and there was this whole other thing going on in our interaction.  It was so deeply felt even though my words were spoken so casually, "well, you know the place better than I, do whatever you think is best."  And you relaxed, and you opened up and you talked to me about your thoughts and feelings and motives behind your reaction now and desire to proceed in a certain way going forward.

As I listened, I could totally see it from your point of view and that you have a very valid and individual and complex and nuanced message as your response.  I respect you setting a boundary and insisting on an official, document response.  You are correct in this and I will support you fully and to the best of my ability through this.  Indeed there are some parts of me that are excited by it.  It is soul destroying to both parties to watch someone grind out a living at work that he hates.  I wish you at least a year off to do projects around the house.  I would love for the house to be your next work.  Full-time.  You can be a stay-at-home dad to Benjamin.  I will support that or any other road you take.  To me, it seems the time has come for you to commit or recommit to some things.  Work is one of those things.  Either fully commit to grinding it out fully commit to doing something else.  I would just like to see you commit to something.  Let's see what happens.
